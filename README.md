#### ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Zaviar / Casuistry

I'm a software developer at [NeuroGames](https://neurogames.com.au/) creating game-based
telehealth products with most of my work being in Minecraft (java). In my spare time I also do work on community projects here and there.

I have a [portfolio website](https://zaviar.me) where you can check out more of my random things.
